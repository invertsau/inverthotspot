    "text": "Invertebrates are an often overlooked but vital component of healthy ecosystems. They perform a variety of critical ecological functions and ecosystem services, including pollination, soil modification, organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, pest control, and food provisioning to other animals and humans (Lavelle et al. 2006; Macadam and Stockan 2015; Griffiths et al. 2021; Porto et al. 2021). They are ubiquitous across land and seascapes, constituting the vast majority of Earth’s biodiversity. Over 1.25 million invertebrate species have been documented, representing around 95% of animal species (Eisenhauer and Hines 2021). However, many invertebrate species and populations around the globe are under threat, as are the services they provide and the ecosystems they support (Hallmann et al. 2017; Ulrich et al. 2020; Wagner et al. 2021; Eisenhauer et al. 2023).\n\nAustralia has a high proportion of endemic fauna and is home to around 320,000 invertebrate species, of which around 35% have been described (Murphy and Leeuwen 2021). These include invertebrates of cultural significance to Indigenous Australians, such as freshwater crayfish (marron), beetle larvae (witchetty grubs), and Bogong moths, used for food, medicine, and ceremonies for thousands of years (Faast and Weinstein 2020; Stephenson et al. 2020; Murphy and Leeuwen 2021). Invertebrates also play vital roles in Australian agriculture, land management, and environmental monitoring (Andersen and Majer 2004; Holloway, Furlong, and Bowden 2008). Despite their ecological, cultural, social, and economic importance, invertebrates are often neglected in conservation and management plans, and a lack of taxonomic and ecological knowledge hinders their protection (Braby 2018, 2019; Sands 2018). Invertebrates constitute 95% of Australia’s faunal diversity but only 15% of species assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act), and only around 480 species of Australian invertebrates are listed as threatened (invertebratesaustralia.org).\nInvertebrates face a multitude of anthropogenic and environmental threats, including habitat loss, climate change (and associated events such as fires, floods, and droughts), pollution, pesticides, and introduced species (Wagner et al. 2021; Marsh et al. 2022; Reddin et al. 2022). There is growing evidence that such pressures, which have seen widespread invertebrate declines around the globe, are impacting Australian species (Braby, Yeates, and Taylor 2021). While there is an urgent need for further research on invertebrate biodiversity and conservation in relation to these threats, conservation measures can help to mitigate their effects, protect and restore biodiversity, and prevent extinctions.\nBiological conservation is hampered by limited resources, and identifying priority areas to focus conservation efforts can help to maximise their effectiveness (Myers et al. 2000). Species richness and endemism are key indices of biodiversity that reflect biological complexity and uniqueness, and can be used to identify ‘biodiversity hotspots’ to prioritise for conservation (Myers 1988; Caldecott et al. 1996; Reid 1998). Species richness refers to the number of species in an area. Numerous definitions of endemism exist but generally a taxon is considered endemic to a particular area if it occurs only in that area (Anderson 1994). Quantifying endemism and identifying areas of high endemism is important in conservation because narrowly endemic taxa have small ranges by definition and are therefore more vulnerable to threats such as habitat loss and climate change (Harvey et al. 2011). The 10 known invertebrate extinctions in Australia were all narrow-range endemics (Braby 2019). There is a need to identify hotspots of invertebrate biodiversity to enhance their conservation, particularly within Australia (Taylor et al. 2018). Designation of protected areas and other landscape management practices can be informed by spatial quantification of endemism. Identifying hotspots helps to focus limited resources and improve the efficiency of biodiversity conservation efforts.\nIdentifying hotspots for all invertebrates is not logistically feasible at present, so as a proof of concept we focussed on spiders in the infraorder Mygalomorphae, using spatial analyses to identify hotspots of species richness and endemism across Australia. Mygalomorph spiders have poor dispersal capabilties and sedentary habits, making them well-suited to endemism analyses (Ferretti, González, and Pérez–Miles 2014). Australian mygalomorphs are diverse and many may face a greater level of threat than what is formally recognised (Castalanelli et al. 2014; Rix et al. 2017). Our methods can be used as a framework and extended to other taxonomic groups. Identifying hotspots of endemism in the Australian invertebrate fauna will help guide research and conservation efforts and improve outcomes, not only for invertebrates, but for the ecological communities they support.\n\n(to move to methods) Quantification of endemism depends on the spatial scale being considered (Townsend Peterson and Watson 1998), and numerous calculation methods exist (). Endemism can be quantified on a continuous scale across a spatial grid with reference to the constituent grid cells, based on how many cells taxa occupy.\n\n\n\n\nAndersen, Alan N., and Jonathan D.

These assertions help users gauge whether data is fit for their purposes and allow for easy data filtering. Assertions are logical variables (TRUE/FALSE) and take the value TRUE when they apply to the associated occurrence record. Descriptions of Assertions can be found at here\nHere, we have focused on spatial and taxonomic assertions because accurate identification of taxa and their spatial distributions is imperative to the calculation of endemism metrics and subsequent mapping.\n\n2.2.5.1 Spatial assertions\nWe investigated a range of spatial assertions and deemed the following safe to bypass when refining the data download:\n\nCOORDINATE_UNCERTAINTY_METERS_INVALID\nWe performed visual checks and flagged records did not seem to be out of species’ range. They were mostly cases where coordinateUncertaintyinMeters was NA. We know iNaturalist records input NA for coordinateUncertaintyinMeters, therefore in refining the data download we will include records where coordinateUncertaintyinMeters is NA or less than 1000 m. We will remove flagged values for a sensitivity analysis later on.\nCOORDINATE_ROUNDED\nThe original coordinates were rounded to six decimals (~ 1 m precision) to simplify processing. The level of precision lost will not affect the endemism analysis.\n\nThe following will be used to refine the data download as they indicate coordinates outside of the given country (records flagged as TRUE will be excluded):\n\nCOORDINATE_OUT_OF_RANGE\nPRESUMED_NEGATED_LONGITUDE\nPRESUMED_NEGATED_LATITUDE\nPRESUMED_SWAPPED_COORDINATE\nZERO_COORDINATE\n\n\n\n2.2.5.2 Taxonomic assertions\nThe following assertions were used to identify taxonomic discrepancies in the data and allow for review by taxonomic experts:\nTAXON_MATCH_FUZZY - is flagged when the supplied scientific name (raw_scientificName) does not exactly match the taxonomic backbone of the Atlas.",

To identify all introduced species in the dataset, we used species lists from the World Spider Catalogue (WSC) and the Global Register of Invasive and Introduced Species (GRIIS).\nThe (WSC) is a comprehensive online database of spiders from around the world, with detailed taxonomic information, distribution maps, references and images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIntroduced species in the WSC matched with 0 records in our data.\n\n\n(GRIIS) is a project by the IUCN SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group to compile annotated and verified country-wise inventories of introduced and invasive species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThere are no arachnids in the Australian GRIIS list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this project, we conclude there are no introduced spiders in our dataset.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Marine Species\nThe World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) was used to identify and remove marine species from the data. WoRMS provides a authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms, including currently valid and alternative names.\nUsing the worrms R package, we supplied our list of 453 species to the wm_records_taxamatch() function to check whether any our taxa are classified as marine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the case of this project, we found 0 taxa that matched with marine species in the WoRMS database.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Geographic Errors\n\naus &lt;- st_transform(ozmaps::ozmap_country, 4326)\n\nbase_map &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = aus, fill = NA) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nBiodiversity data, especially citizen science data can have various geographic imperfections. For example, occurrence records may include data from institutions such as botanic gardens or zoos which may not be reflective of a specie’s natural range. There may be data entry errors where the default location of a taxa is assumed to be the center of particular region. For these reasons, we used the R package CoordinateCleaner to investigate potential errors in our dataset.\nWe used the clean_coordinates() function and tested whether any of our coordinates were the following:\n\nGeneral coordinate validity\nCountry and province centroids\nCapital coordinates\nCoordinates of biodiversity institutions\nSpatial outliers\nTemporal outliers\nAssigned to the location of the GBIF headquarters\nLocated in Urban areas\nLocated in the sea\nDuplicated values\nPlain zeros\n\nTable of the number of observations flagged by CoordinateCleaner’s testing suite:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest\nNumber of Observations\n\n\n\n\n.val\n0\n\n\n.equ\n0\n\n\n.zer\n0\n\n\n.cap\n48\n\n\n.cen\n0\n\n\n.sea\n418\n\n\n.urb\n1292\n\n\n.otl\n119\n\n\n.gbf\n0\n\n\n.inst\n26\n\n\n.dpl\n2970\n\n\n.summary\n4125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinateCleaner, identified a large number of duplicates which we have a separate workflow in Section 2.3.5 so we decided to ignore the duplicates flagged by CoordinateCleaner.\nAfter some consideration:\n\n48 records excluded due to being near a capital vicinity (0.51%)\n26 records excluded due to being in the vicinity of biodiversity institutions (0.28%).\n418 records excluded due to being in sea (4.45%).\n\nWe will consult the taxonomic experts regarding records flagged as being in the sea and found in urban areas. At this stage, given the number records are precious, we decide to include these records for the analyses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAfter removing these geographic errors, we have 8888 observations after the exclusion, 437 species.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Duplicate Records\nDuplicate records can affect statistical analyses by pseudoreplication (increasing sample size but not adding information). We noticed that some records that had the same coordinate values for a large number of different species. These records were typically from museum record providers, we suspect this was due to the sampling method e.g. pitfall traps. For this reason, we decided to remove records if they fulfiled the following critiera:\n\nthe record was duplicated at the species level\nhad same exact coordinates\nhad same time and date of collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUsing this method, we excluded 2513 from the dataset (26.75%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAfter deduplication, we have 6375 observations after the exclusion, 404 species.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Minimum number of observations\nThe final step in our data cleaning workflow is to exclude any species that have fewer than three observations as this is a key requirement for the generation of alpha hulls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe identified 185 species with fewer than three observations. This resulted in an exclusion of 324 observations (3.45%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAfter removing data-deficient taxa, we have 6051 observations after the exclusion, 219 species.",

An alpha-hull can be computed using a minimum of three data points, which allows the inclusion of data-deficient invertebrates in our endemism analysis\nUsing the cleaned data, we applied the EOO.computing() function from R package ConR to quantify alpha-hulls for all species that had at least 3 records (n = ). We used an alpha value of 2 and a buffer size of 0.000001 (which approximates to ~100m). The alpha-hull workflow is laid out in this document.\nAlpha-hulls were converted into SpatialPolgyon objects using the sp R package and exported for endemism analysis",

    "text": "2.5 Biodiversity metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource code\n\n\n\nThe biodiversity metrics workflow can be found here\n\n\nIn order to quantify patterns of species richness and endemism, we need to convert our point based (i.e. coordinates for each occurrence of a species) into a community matrix, whereby each row in the matrix corresponds to a different site, while each column represents a different species. The entries in the matrix indicate whether a species is present at a particular site (often with a 1 for presence and 0 for absence) or how abundant the species is at that site. See here for further information.\nWe converted our alpha-hulls into a community matrix using the poly2comm() function in the phyloregion R package. The resolution or grid size is set at 0.5 decimal degrees. The poly2comm() also computes abundance (the number of individuals in each cell) and species rich (number of species in each cell).\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity matrix of Mygalomorphae spiders from our cleaned dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity matrix of Mygalomorphae spiders from our cleaned dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Quantifying endemism\nEndemism is a measure of rarity relative to other species (refs). There are multiple metrics to assess which areas are of importance for Mygal spiders, each have their own caveats. In order to get a fuller picture of the distribution of species and importantly, rare species that are limited in their range, we need to use a combination of endemism metrics.\n\n2.5.1.1 Weighted endemism\nWeighted endemism is species richness inversely weighted by species ranges(Crisp et al. 2001),(Laffan and Crisp 2003),(Barnabas H. Daru et al. 2020). It gives higher weight to species with smaller ranges, emphasizing areas with many range-restricted species. WE highlights areas with a high concentration of rare species, which can be crucial for conservation efforts, however regions with high species richness can have inflated WE values simply because they have more species, not necessarily more endemics (https://www.jstor.org/stable/3554498).\nWe calculated WE using the weighted_endemism() from phyloregion package.\n\n\n2.5.1.2 Corrected weighted endemism\nCorrected weighted endemism accounts for species richness in each cell. This correction accounts for the fact that areas with more species are likely to have more endemics by chance alone (Crisp and Laffan). It provides a balanced measure, considering rarity and richness and range sizes.\nWe calculated CWE by dividing the WE in each grid cell by species richness.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Statistical inference\nWe calculated the Moran’s I test statistic, to determine whether spatial patterns of species richness, abundance and endemism for Mygalomorphs are distributed in a way that is not expected by random chance. Moran’s I is a statistical measure used to assess spatial autocorrelation, which is the degree to which a set of spatial features e.g occurrences or polygons are clustered, dispersed, or randomly distributed across a geographic area (ref).\nMoran’s I ranges from -1 to 1:\n\n1: Perfect positive spatial autocorrelation (values are highly clustered).\n0: No spatial autocorrelation (random distribution).\n-1: Perfect negative spatial autocorrelation (values are perfectly dispersed).",
