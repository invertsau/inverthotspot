### Aim

The goal of this project was to design a fully reproducible, end-to-end workflow to identify biodiversity hotspots for Australian invertebrates. Here, the workflow was applied to _Mygalomorphae_, a group of burrow-dwelling spiders including trapdoor spiders, funnel webs, and tarantulas. 

### Methods

We used occurrence data from the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) for this analysis. We created two datasets for analyses: 

1. 'Citizen science + preserved specimen' dataset (number of species = `r myg_spiders_cleaned$species |> unique() |> length()`, number of observations = `r nrow(myg_spiders_cleaned)`)
2. 'Preserved specimen only' (number of species = `r myg_spiders_cleaned_expert$species |> unique() |> length()`, number of observations = `r nrow(myg_spiders_cleaned_expert)`)

We computed alpha-hulls, a form of spatial polygon, to represent each species' distribution for endemism analyses.

Species richness (RI), weighted endemism (WE) and corrected weighted endemsim (CWE) were used as metrics to define biodiversity hotspots. Species richness refers to the number of species in an area. Numerous definitions of endemism exist but generally a species is considered endemic to a particular area if it occurs only in that area. Weighted endemism is species richness inversely weighted by species' ranges, which gives higher weight to range-restricted species that are likely to be of conservation significance.

Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics were used to identify spatial clustering in biodiversity metrics and test whether spatial patterns were statistically significant.

### Results

- Hotspots for _Mygalomorph_ spiders were identified in each biodiversity metric (RI, WE, and CWE), in both datasets.
- CWE identified different hotspots compared to RI and WE.
- Two main hotspots of RI and WE were identified: a large cluster centred around Brisbane, spanning south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales, and another centred around Cairns in the Wet Tropics of Queensland.
- Both datasets showed hotspots of CWE in south-west Western Australia and in the northern Cape York Peninsula, as well as a small hotspot in central Australia near the Warburton Range. The full dataset also showed a small hotspot located between Canberra and Sydney in New South Wales.

### Conclusions

Notable biodiversity hotspots were identified for _Mygalomorph_ spiders in Australia: 

- South-east Queensland/north-east New South Wales
- Cairns area in the Wet Tropics of Queensland 
- South-west Western Australia

Using a variety of biodiversity metrics can help to identify different hotspots.

The full dataset (including citizen science data) and the preserved specimen only dataset provided highly congruent results, however this may have been due to the relatively small proportion of citizen science data. Citizen science data may be valuable for endemism analyses, particularly for taxonomic groups that can be reliably identified to species level using photographs.

This workflow can be applied to different taxonomic groups, which will help guide the conservation and management of Australian invertebrates.
