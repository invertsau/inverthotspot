### Aim

The goal of this project is to design a fully reproducible, end-to-end workflow to identify biodiversity hotspots for Australian Invertebrates. Here, the workflow was applied to _Mygalomorphae_ spiders, a group known to consist of trapdoor spiders, funnel webs and tarantlas). 

### Method

We used occurrence data from the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) for this analysis. We created two datasets for analyses: 

1. 'Citizen science + preserved specimen' dataset (number of species = `r myg_spiders_cleaned$species |> unique() |> length()`, number of observations = `r nrow(myg_spiders_cleaned)`)
2. 'Preserved specimen only' (number of species = `r myg_spiders_cleaned_expert$species |> unique() |> length()`, number of observations = `r nrow(myg_spiders_cleaned_expert)`)

We computed alpha-hulls, a form of spatial polygon to represent each species distribution for endemism analyses.

Species richness (SR), weighted endemism (WE) and corrected weighted endemsim (CEW) were used as metrics to define hotspots. [Briefly describe each of these]


Moran's I test was used to test whether spatial patterns were statistically significant.

### Results

- Overall signals for 'hotspots' were weak for _Mygalomorphae_ spiders. 
- No 'hotspots' were identified using the 'citizen science + preserved specimen' dataset
- In the 'preserved specimen only' dataset, there was some evidence of 'hotspots' using WE and CWE

### Conclusions

Preserved specimen data provided better detection rates of endemism hotspots in _Mygalomorphae_ spiders

Notable endemism hotspots identified for _Mygalomorphae_ spiders in this analyses include: 

- Tropical far north Queensland
- South East coast of New South Wales
- Rural Victoria
- Adelaide and Kangaroo Island
- South West coast of Perth 
- Southern coast of Perth

There is still value for citizen science data for endemism analyses particularly for taxonomic groups that can be identified to species level using photographs.
