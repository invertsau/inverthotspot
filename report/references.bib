	abstract = {Aim To detect centres of vascular plant endemism at a continental scale by analysis of specimen-based distributional data and to relate any pattern to environmental factors and history. Location Australia. Methods Presence of 8468 seed plant species-level taxa throughout continental Australia and Tasmania was mapped on a 1$\,^{\circ}$ grid to visualize the pattern of species richness. This sample comprises half the known flora. Three indices of endemism were calculated but we preferred one that is unrelated to species richness, so that these two concepts could be distinguished in practice. Centres of endemism were detected by simple mapping and by spatial autocorrelation analysis (SAC). Linear regression was used to examine the relationship of the patterns of species richness and endemism to latitude, topography and climate. Results Both species richness and endemism vary greatly across the continent but in most cases the same centres were high in both richness and endemism. Twelve distinct centres were identified. The major centres of both diversity and endemism are south-west western Australia, the Border Ranges between New South Wales and Queensland, the Wet Tropics near Cairns, Tasmania and the Iron-McIlwraith Range of eastern Cape York Peninsula. The last centre appears to be more significant than recognized by past authors. Whether this is a true Australian centre of endemism, or is largely an outlier of the flora of Papua New Guinea, is explored. Another centre, in the Adelaide--Kangaroo Island region, has been overlooked altogether by previous authors. Regression analysis did not find a simple climatic explanation of the observed patterns. There was a suggestion that topographic variation within the 1$\,^{\circ}$ cells may be positively correlated with endemism, which is consistent with mountainous regions functioning as refugia. One clear result is that all the major centres of endemism are near-coastal. A likely explanation is that Pleistocene expansions of the central desert have been a powerful limitation on the viability of refugia for narrowly endemic species. All the centres of endemism lie outside the estimated limits of the expanded arid zone at the last glacial maximum (18,000 yr BP). In particular, the `Central Australian Mountain Ranges centre of plant diversity and endemism' of Boden \& Given (1995) is detected as a strong centre of species richness, but not at all as a centre of endemism. This is despite good sampling of this region. Main conclusions Endemism can be distinguished from species richness by using an appropriate index and mapping of such indices can detect centres of endemism. This study demonstrates the value of specimen based distributional data, such as is held in state herbaria and museums.},

    abstract = { There are three major difficulties encountered by those dealing with the phenomenon of endemism: a semantic problem, the absence of a clear conceptual framework, and an analytical problem. First, the terms endemic and endemism are used in the literature in unclear or contradictory ways. Often neither the title nor the abstract of an article makes the meaning clear. Following the usage that tends to prevail among Anglo-American zoogeographers, a species or other taxon is regarded here as endemic to an area if it occurs only in that area. To speak of a taxon as endemic in this context without specifying an area is meaningless. Since geographic ranges of taxa change with time, time must also be specified, or at least understood. Second, a conceptual model is provided in which only changes in ranges (occuring frequently) and speciation (occuring relatively rarely) are seen to change the percentage of endemism in any given area. At a subsidiary level, many complex factors influence areographic changes and speciation. Among the more important of these are: distance from source to target area, size of area, geological age of area, time since isolation, environemntal variety and stability, and vagility and ecological tolerance of organisms being considered. These are not all independent factors. This complexity leads to the third and still largely unresolved problem namely how to analyse a global biological system involving processes on both a shorter-term ecological time scale and a longer-term evolutionary time scale. }

abstract = {Summary The concept of endemism is useful in quantifying the biological uniqueness of an area, and has been used by many authors as a meaningful alternative to simple species richness. The traditional definition of endemism includes those species with ranges restricted to a particular region, and therefore is useful only in reference to that region. To compare different regions, however, a standardized approach is required, so several authors began using area-based definitions. Accordingly, those species with ranges smaller than a particular area (e.g. 50,000 km 2) are deemed endemic. Nevertheless, several problems are associated with this approach: as the area threshold changes, scaling of endemism also changes, producing a different picture of endemism for each spatial scale. Moreover, the areal definition assumes equal levels of heterogeneity in different landscapes (clearly a simplification), which overemphasizes fine-grained regions. Herein, the importance of distinguishing the regional definition (endemism) from the areal definition (range restriction) is emphasized, and investigators are encouraged to consider multiple spatial scales and geographic dimensions in evaluations of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Invertebrates play significant, but largely ignored, roles in the delivery of ecosystem services by soils at plot and landscape scales. They participate actively in the interactions that develop in soil among physical, chemical and biological processes. We show that soils have all the attributes of self-organized systems as proposed by Perry (Trends Ecol. Evol. 10 (1995) 241) and detail the scales at which invertebrates operate and the different kinds of ecosystem engineering that they develop. This comprehensive analysis of invertebrate activities shows that they may be the best possible indicators of soil quality. They should also be considered as a resource that needs to be properly managed to enhance ecosystem services provided by agro-ecosystems.}

abstract = {Summary Soil invertebrates make significant contributions to the recycling of dead plant material across the globe. However, studies focussed on the consequences of decomposition for plant communities largely ignore soil fauna across all ecosystems, because microbes are often considered the primary agents of decay. Here, we explore the role of invertebrates as not simply facilitators of microbial decomposition, but as true decomposers, able to break down dead organic matter with their own endogenic enzymes, with direct and indirect impacts on the soil environment and plants. We recommend a holistic view of decomposition, highlighting how invertebrates and microbes act in synergy to degrade organic matter, providing ecological services that underpin plant growth and survival.},

Population declines of vertebrate and invertebrate pollination vectors may threaten human nutrition and well-being, particularly where agriculture relies heavily on animal pollinators. We examined the relative differences in nutrient concentrations of 45 leading crops produced throughout Brazil, the world's largest tropical agricultural producer and exporter. We also estimated the overall reductions in nutrient yields under different scenarios of pollinator declines, based on annual agricultural production. Of the 45 top-ranking crops, 29 and 16 were classified as pollinator-dependent and non-dependent, respectively. Pollinator-dependent crops provided 47% of all dietary nutrients supplied in 2017, which had significantly higher concentrations of lipids, vitamin B9, and potassium, while pollinator non-dependent crops provided higher carbohydrate content. Under either a best- or worst-case pollinator declines scenario, we estimate overall nutritional losses of 7.9% and 29.5%, respectively. These losses ranged from 4% to 18% for all macronutrients, 6.8%–26.2% for all minerals, and 2.4%–31.5% for all vitamins. We emphasize the need for land-use strategies that sustain, if not increase pollinator abundance and species diversity to ensure agricultural viability and future food security.}

abstract = {1. Freshwater ecosystems cover less than 1\% of the planet's surface but support up to 10\% of known species. Around 25\% of freshwater invertebrate species are under threat of extinction. Such a decline in species richness is likely to lead to adverse effects on the delivery of services. However, the effect of species loss on ecosystem goods and services can only be assessed once the link between species diversity and ecosystem goods and services has been established and better understood. 2. Using a flexible systematic literature review search protocol, we were able to identify a range of ecosystem goods and services provided by freshwater insects in the categories of provisioning, supporting, and cultural services. 3. The ecosystem services and benefits provided by freshwater insects are diverse and unexpectedly wide-ranging including decomposition and nutrient cycling, food for a wider range of species including humans, and the inspiration for art, music, and literature. Several of these have clear economic values but are not currently fully exploited. 4. The identification of goods and services may bring greater appreciation and impetus to understanding the scale of their importance, economic value, and conservation. In the absence of freshwater insects, few other service providers could replicate the same level and degree of service.},
