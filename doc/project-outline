# Endemism Analysis

## Data download
- <1000m uncertainty
- Exclude NA in: date, decimalLatitude, decimalLongtitude, species | scientificName
- Narrow down to: basisofrecord to specimen, machine observation, material 
- Exclude assertions: ZERO_COORDINATE, PRESUMED_NEGATED_LATITUDE, PRESUMED_SWAPPED_COORDINATE, PRESUMED_NEGATED_LONGITUDE

## Data overview
- Download date
- Query 

## Data clean
### Coarse clean
- Exclude NA species
- Exclude NA decimalLat and decimalLong
- Exclude NA eventDate
- Filter down to taxonRank == species
- Obs greater than 3 obs
- All in mainland Australia and Tasmania

* Records that were excluded here

### Fine Clean
- Marine species (WORMS)
- Coordinate cleaner
- Introduced species (WSC, GRIIS)
- Duplicates

* Records that were excluded here

## Dataset overview
- Number of observations across genus, family represented (plot)
- Number of species across genus, family represented (plot)
- Top 5 species and Bottom 5

### Synonyms from AFD
- Which species? Reassigned?

### Taxonomic assertions that need reviewing: (raw_scientificName, scientificName, species, raw_vernacularName)
TAXON_MATCH_FUZZY
TAXON_EXCLUDED
TAXON_SPECIES_PLURAL
TAXON_QUESTION_SPECIES
TAXON_HOMONYM

### Spatial assertions that need reviewing: (Map of assertion by species)
- COORDINATES_CENTRE_OF_STATEPROVINCE
- STATE_COORDINATE_MISMATCH

## Generate spatial polygons
- Alpha-hulls using ConR no buffer or subpopulations

## Endemism analysis using polygons
- Weighted endemism
- Corrected weighted endemism
